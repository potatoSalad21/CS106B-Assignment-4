### Explanation of the Makefile
- `PROGRAM = Fiso` → Defines the output executable name.
- `OBJECTS = Fiso.o` → Lists object files required for compilation.
- `CPPOPTIONS = -IStanfordCPPLib -fvisibility-inlines-hidden` → Sets include paths and visibility options.
- `LDOPTIONS = -L.` → Specifies the directory where libraries are searched.
- `LIB = -lStanfordCPPLib` → Links the compiled Stanford C++ Library.
- `all: $(PROGRAM)` → The default rule, builds the program.
- `$(PROGRAM): $(OBJECTS)` → Links the object file to create the final executable.
- `$(OBJECTS): Fiso.cpp Makefile libStanfordCPPLib.a` → Compiles `Fiso.cpp` into an object file.
- `libStanfordCPPLib.a:` → Ensures the library is built before compilation.
- `clean:` → Removes compiled files to allow a fresh rebuild.
